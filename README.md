# AWS Terraform Test Automation

## **Overview**
This repository serves as a testing ground for automating the deployment and management of AWS infrastructure using **Terraform**. It is designed to validate Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) workflows, implement best practices, and experiment with various AWS services to ensure secure, scalable, and reliable deployments.

---

## **Objectives**
- Automate the provisioning and management of AWS resources using Terraform.
- Test and validate deployment workflows.
- Experiment with AWS services such as EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, and more.
- Implement best practices for infrastructure automation, monitoring, and configuration management.

---

## **Features**
- **Reusable Modules**: Modular Terraform code for common AWS services.
- **Automated Pipelines**: Integration with CI/CD tools for deployment and validation.
- **Secrets Management**: Support for AWS Secrets Manager and HashiCorp Vault.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Configurations for enhanced observability.
- **Secure Design**: Examples of secure, compliant AWS infrastructure setups.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure-as-code tool for automating resource deployments.
- **AWS**: Cloud platform for hosting and managing infrastructure.
- **CI/CD Tools**: Tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automation workflows.
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager and HashiCorp Vault for secure handling of sensitive data.
